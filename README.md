# Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-Algorithm
Its an algorithm used for Dimensionality reduction in ML
This ML algo can be used both in supervised as well as unsupervised learning.
This is used for dimensional reduction in the form of data compression, noise reduction etc.
So the data sets are plotted as the independent or dependent variable in case of supervised learning.
And the principal components are assigned with the help of the projection from the data sets in the best fit line.
